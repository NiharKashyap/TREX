# TREX
AI to play google TREX game
This is a simple AI. I used a python script which monitors the pixel values of the space just in front of the dinosaur. As soon as the pixel value changes it means there is an obstacle in front. The script triggers a jump. 

It only works till the obstacles are grounded. It does not work for airborne obstacles.
